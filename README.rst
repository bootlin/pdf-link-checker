pdf-link-checker
================
**pdf-link-checker** is a simple tool that parses a PDF document and checks for
broken hyperlinks. This done by sending a simple HTTP request to each link
found in a given document.

Getting it running
==================

::

    pip install git+https://github.com/bootlin/pdf-link-checker.git
    export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
    pdf-link-checker my-awesome-slides.pdf

Options
=======

* --max-threads

  Specifies the maximum number of allowed threads (default: 100).

  To speedup the run, pdf-link-checker will launch several threads
  in order to check several links in parallel.
  This option allows to set a limit to the number of threads.

* --max-requests-per-host

  Specifies the maximum number of allowed requests per host.

  Some URLs may belong to the same host, and since pdf-link-checker
  can check many URLs at the same time, we may want to set a limit
  to the number of requests per host.
  Otherwise, some hosts may confuse the check with a DoS attack.

TODO
====

*(...because there's no active project without a TODO list!)*

* Fix: some documents are failing on doc.initialize().

* Fix: if the URL is a huge document, we should just check and not
  download it entirely.

* Replace the thread array into a nice thread pool.
  Each thread from the pool should take an URL from a (protected) queue.
  We could also have one queue per host and thus handle the
  max-requests-per-host constraint without a separate parameter.
